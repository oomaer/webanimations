                        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                          when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

                        of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a
                        more-or-less normal distribution of letters, 
                        as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
